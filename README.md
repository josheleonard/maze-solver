# Maze Solver Visualization

## Goal

Create a React app that visualizes a maze and solves it using algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

## Key Features:

- Load a maze (a simple 2D array where 0 represents open space and 1 represents walls)
- Visualizes the maze as a grid where cells are either walls or open spaces.
- Implements a button that starts the maze-solving algorithm and visually shows the steps as the algorithm explores the maze.
- Highlights the final path from start to finish.

## Running the app

1. install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. run the dev server:
   `npm run dev`
